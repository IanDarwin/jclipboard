= JClipboard

NB This repo only had one source file so it has been merged into
my general-purpose library,
https://github.com/IanDarwin/darwinsys-api[darwinsys-api].

Maintains a list of clipboard shortcuts, each a name-value pair.

Tries to iconify itself into the system taskbar, where supported.

Properties are stored in a Java properties file in your home directory,
jclipboard.properties, which can safely be edited while the program
is not running.
